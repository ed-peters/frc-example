# Intake Subsystem

This is a subsystem for an intake. A few learnings that are embedded here ...

**Spinning wheels are similar**. This is a simple flywheel subsystem; it could probably be used as the basis for e.g. a shooter as well.

**There are multiple "speeds"**. The motor speed determines the wheel speed, dependent on the gear ratio. The wheel speed determines how "fast" a piece moves through the system, dependent on the radius of the attached wheel. In 2024, we had to match the speed of two different-sized subsystems in feet per second to avoid damaging a gamepiece. This subsystem allows control using any of the three speeds.
